----------------

-----

* Viewpoint: _People should be able to find quickly and accurately the price for a second hand car, whether at home or on the go._
* Goal: _Car Price Finder provides easy access second hand car valuations whenever and wherever you need them._

-----

### Test Objectives
The test aims to get a better idea of how does the prototype work accross three dimensions, namely Site usability, how easy is it to use the site; site feasibility, do the users find the design useful and do they see themselves using the site regularly; and finally mobile vs desktop comparison, to see what they prefer and to identify anything that could be left out or put in on each side.

#### Site usability:
* Is it easy to use for non-experienced users?
* Are the controls on the right place, where people expect them to be?
* Is the information provided easy to understand? Do people have to search for the information or does it just pop out?

#### Site feasibility:
* Can users think about other tools they'd use instead of Car Price Finder?
* Were users expecting more information? i.e. is there anything to be added?
* Were users expecting less information? i.e. is there anything to be left out?

#### Mobile vs Desktop site:
* Are there things on the destkop version that users miss on the mobile version?
* Could we strip out non-essential things from the Desktop site and still retain the same core functionality?
